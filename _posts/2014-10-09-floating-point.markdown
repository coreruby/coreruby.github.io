You’ve written some absurdly simple code, say for example:

```ruby
>> 0.1 + 0.2
```

and got a really unexpected result:

```ruby
=> 0.30000000000000004
```

Maybe you asked for help on some forum and got pointed to a long
article with lots of formulas that didn’t seem to help with your
problem.

[Here] is a [website][Here] that can help you with all things float.
