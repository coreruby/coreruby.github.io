title: Stop Including Enumerable
category: posts

An interesting read by Robert Pankowecki is [`Stop including Enumerable, return Enumerator instead`](http://blog.arkency.com/2014/01/ruby-to-enum-for-enumerator/).

Great food for thought. Do you agree? Should we really stop including
Enumerable? Why? If you have something to say, leave an answer at [Hack Bulgaria
