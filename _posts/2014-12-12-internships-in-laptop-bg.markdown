[laptop.bg][] is organizing a 3 month internship program focused on Ruby on
Rails.

The internship is suitable for students interested in Ruby, Rails and are
seeking a professional web development career. Previous experience is **not**
required.

The internship offers you a 4 hour workday with a flexible schedule,
personalized for your lectures and exams.

[laptop.bg][] is working successfully with Ruby on Rails for 5 years. In that,
time, they have learnt that sharing the experience, the meeting of new people
and the joy of programming lead to wonderful results.

The internship programs are a great way to introduce young software developers
into a real working environment, while still being able to focus on their
studies.

If this sounds tempting, send [laptop.bg] a message on **info@tutuf.com** until
15th of February 2015.
