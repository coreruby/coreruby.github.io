It has been an amazing 2 months and our cozy little Ruby class has come to an
end.

## The Sponsors

I wanna thank all of our partners for making this class possible.

Shout-out to [laptop.bg][] and Software Society for sponsoring the class. Big
hugs to [GitHub][], who sent us the wonderful swag we were able to give to our
lovely students.

## The People

A lot of great folks got involved with the class. Let's start with [Radoslav
Georgiev][] for the great [HackBulgaria][] organization and the belief for a
better IT education in Bulgaria.

Kudos to my friends Akseniya Penkova and [Stanislav Gatev][] for covering
me for a week and keeping the class moving.

Special thanks go to [Radoslav Stankov][] and [Bozhidar Batsov][] for their
awesome guest lectures and <3 to the [FMI Ruby][] class for the exercises we
borrowed.

## The Students

Last, but not least, I wanna thank all the students who kept the spark going.
Let's keep in touch!
